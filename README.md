# DivisionAndMultiplications

An extremely basic way to get a gist of a weapon's power for The Division 2.

After reaching level 30 I noticed that differences have become harder to see at a glance. I found myself splitting hairs, doing calculations in my head when all I wanted was to play and have fun. I wrote myself this little page which is by no means a bullet proof method of knowing exactly the damage a weapon can output. It does not take into account buffs, talents or any other elements that could increase or decrease DMG.

Users shall not rely on it for anything other than for having a way to check quickly a weapon's raw timings and output.

IT IS WRITTEN FOR MOBILE DEVICES.
